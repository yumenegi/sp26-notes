### Motivation
- Tools to analyze computer systems and the algorithms
  - Distribution of inputs
  - Arrival patterns of tasks
  - Computer resources
- Applications in healthcare, transportation systems, smart power grid
- Probability is used to evaluate system design and performance
  - Throughput
  - Response time
  - Reliability
  - Availability

### Experimental Analysis
- Need to specify various probability distributions
- Sample space
- You can combine probabilities so long they follow the rules of probability

### Basic Steps to solving Problems
1. Identifying the sample space $S$
   1. No two elements can occur simultaneously and one element must occur on any trial
   2. All its elements ar emutually exclusive and coillectively exhaustive
2. Assign probabilities to the elements in $S$
   1. Can be assigned to individual characteristics
   2. Must be consistent with the axioms of probabilties
3. Identity the events of interests
   1. How often/how likely a certain event is going to occur
   2. Developing insight based on probabilities

### Basic Concepts
- **Random Experiment**
  - Outcome is not certain
- **Sample Space**
  - The totality of all possible outcomes
  - Any outcome will happen within the sample space
  - The chance that an outcome will occur is always greater than or equal to 1 (?)
- **Discrete**
  - Countable
  - Countably infinite
- **Continous Sample Space**

### Events
- An event is a collection of certain sample points
  - A subset of the sample space
- An event is defined as a statement whose truth or falsity is determined after the experiment
- e.g. An event is the times a coin toss results in 9 heads out of 10 throws
- The set of all outcomes for which the statement is true defines the subset of the sample space corresponding to the target event
- Elementary event is the event consisting of a single sample point
- $E$ is an event is defined in the sample space $S$
  - $E \subset S$
- Outcome of a specific trial is an element $s$
- If $s$ has occursed, $E$ has occursed
- $s$ may be an element in multiple events
  - Many events may occur
- Universal event is the entire sample space $S$
- The null set $\emptyset$ is a null or impossible event

### Terminology Example
- Experiments
  - Toss a fair coin
- Outcomes
  - Heads or tail
- Trials
  - Do this $x$ times

### Terminology
- Sample Space ($\Omega$)
  - The set of possible outcomes of an experiment
- Event
  - A subset of the sameple space

### Describing Probability
- If every outcome is equally probable
  - $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$

### Rolling Two Dice and Non-Equal Probable Sample Space
- Roll two fair dices, probability of the sum being 6
- $\Omega _1 = \{2, 3, 4, ... , 12\}$
- $A _1 = \{7\}$
- We have two construct a new sample space
- $\Omega _2 = \{ [1,1], [1,2], ..., [6,6]\}$
- $A _2 = \{[1,5], [2,4]..., [5,1]\}$

### K-Maps
- Sum of the probability of all the boxes

### Event Axioms
1. $\Omega \in \mathscr{F}$ is an event
2. If $A \in \mathscr{F}$, then $A ^c \in \mathscr{F}$ 
3. If $A \in \mathscr{F}$, $B \in \mathscr{F}$, then $A \cup B \in \mathscr{F}$ 
4. $\emptyset \in \mathscr{F}$
5. If $A \in \mathscr{F}$, $B \in \mathscr{F}$, then $A \cap B \in \mathscr{F}$

### Probability Axioms
1. $\forall A \in \mathscr{F}, P(A) \leq 1$
2. If $A,B \in \mathscr{F}$ and $A,B$ are mutually exclusive then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$
3. $P(\Omega) = 1$
4. $P(A ^c) = 1 - P(A)$
5. $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB)$

### Counting
- Independent Experiments
  - Toss a coin and roll a die
  - Roll a die twice
- Dependent Experiments
  - Bin of balls
  - Draw two balls
  - Pokers
> e.g. Toss a coin and roll a die
> $\Omega _c = \{H,T\}, \Omega _d = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
> $\Omega = \{H1, H2, H3, ... , T1, T2...\}$
> $|\Omega| = |\Omega _c| \times |\Omega _d| = 2 \times 6 = 12$
> $|A| = |\{ H2, H4, H6, T2, T4, T6\}| = |\Omega _c| \times |A _d| = 2 \times 3 = 6$, where $A$ is the event we roll an even number on the die
- **For independent events**, $P(AB) = P(A)P(B)$

### Principle of Counting for Independent Experiments
- If there are $m$ ways to select one variable, and $n$ ways to select the other
- If these variables are selected independently
- Then there are $m \times n$ ways to make the pair of selections

### Principle of Counting for Dependent Experiments
- Drawing socks from 4 pairs of black and 2 pairs white socks
- The first draw affects the second one
- $P(\text{Draw two socks, color is the same})$
- $\Omega _1 = \{ B1, B2, ..., B8, W1, W2, ..., W4\}$
- $A=\{B1B2, B1B3, ..., B7B8, W1,W2, ..., W3W4\}$

### Permutation
- The number of ways to order $n$ different items
- How many ways can you order letters $A, B, C, D$?
  - $|A|=N!$
- What if we want to order $A, B, C, ..., G$ but only pick 4?
  - $|A|= \frac{7!}{3!}$
- What if we want to order letters of ILLINI?
  - We have duplicates
  - $|A|= \frac{6!}{2!3!}$
