### Motivation
- Tools to analyze computer systems and the algorithms
  - Distribution of inputs
  - Arrival patterns of tasks
  - Computer resources
- Applications in healthcare, transportation systems, smart power grid
- Probability is used to evaluate system design and performance
  - Throughput
  - Response time
  - Reliability
  - Availability

### Experimental Analysis
- Need to specify various probability distributions
- Sample space
- You can combine probabilities so long they follow the rules of probability

### Basic Steps to solving Problems
1. Identifying the sample space $S$
   1. No two elements can occur simultaneously and one element must occur on any trial
   2. All its elements ar emutually exclusive and coillectively exhaustive
2. Assign probabilities to the elements in $S$
   1. Can be assigned to individual characteristics
   2. Must be consistent with the axioms of probabilties
3. Identity the events of interests
   1. How often/how likely a certain event is going to occur
   2. Developing insight based on probabilities

### Basic Concepts
- **Random Experiment**
  - Outcome is not certain
- **Sample Space**
  - The totality of all possible outcomes
  - Any outcome will happen within the sample space
  - The chance that an outcome will occur is always greater than or equal to 1 (?)
- **Discrete**
  - Countable
  - Countably infinite
- **Continous Sample Space**

### Events
- An event is a collection of certain sample points
  - A subset of the sample space
- An event is defined as a statement whose truth or falsity is determined after the experiment
- e.g. An event is the times a coin toss results in 9 heads out of 10 throws
- The set of all outcomes for which the statement is true defines the subset of the sample space corresponding to the target event
- Elementary event is the event consisting of a single sample point
- $E$ is an event is defined in the sample space $S$
  - $E \subset S$
- Outcome of a specific trial is an element $s$
- If $s$ has occursed, $E$ has occursed
- $s$ may be an element in multiple events
  - Many events may occur
- Universal event is the entire sample space $S$
- The null set $\emptyset$ is a null or impossible event
