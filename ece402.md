## 01/20 & 01/22
### Administration & Exam Tips
* **Dates**: Jan 20and Jan 232.
* **Study Strategy**: Bolded topics are shown to appear on exams.
* **Upcoming**: There is a quiz on the lab handout.
* **Next Lecture**: Review routing questions and mixer setup.
### History of Electronic Music 
### Power & Deployment
* **Columbian Exposition of 1893**: Historically important for the deployment of power.
* **Industry Rivalries**: GDC vs. GE and AC vs. Westinghouse.
* **Early Audio**: References to the Phonograph.

### The Telharmonium 
* **Significance**: Considered the "first purely electronic" synthesizer[cite: 25].
* **Distribution**: Utilized manually switched telephone systems [cite: 21] to play music when lines were free[cite: 22, 23].
* **Technical Limitations**: Signals suffered from crosstalk[cite: 24].
* **Hardware**: Consisted of large equipment with no amplification[cite: 33].
* **Sound Generation**: 
    * Generated by tone wheels driven by motors [cite: 30] using magnetic components[cite: 29].
    * Pickups were used to pick up motion from changing magnetic fields[cite: 32].
* **Timbre Control**: Timbre can be altered [cite: 34, 35] by using multiple pickups[cite: 36].
* **Harmonics**: Harmonics are generated from the same shaft[cite: 37].

### Spectral Analysis
* **Frequency**: The fundamental frequency is determined by the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)[cite: 39].

## 01/27/26
### Theremin
- Built by Leon Theremin
- Tube Theremin
- Capacitive Coupling between the hand and the antennas to create the sound
- Theremin hand positoin system
  - Not gesture recognizing
  - Some sort of starting point and reference point for beginners
- Dirty sine wave ish output
- Part of the "timbre"
  - Vibrato
- Variable pitch oscillator
- Antenna acts as a capacitor with human body
  - Generates a intermediate kHz range
- Intermediate fixed pitch oscillator
- Third tube, detector modulator
  - Basically multiplying the two signals together
  - Two grids
  - Similar to envelope detector
    - Detect AM signal
  - Superheterodyne 
    - Frequency shifting
  - Creates two sidebands
    - Filter out the upper band
- Volume antenna
  - Generates volume envelope
- If slightly off when dueting with another instrument 
  - Beating
  - Disonance

### Improvement of Theremin
- Maurice Martenot
- Continuous control
- Right hand can control pitch with ring connected to potentiometer
- Using left hand to control amplitude with an ingot "touche"
- Output speaker of Martenot
  - Has tuned strings for resonance in front of the speaker hole
- More jumping around

### Resonance Filter
- Playing a different pitch, the resonance filter does not change for acoustic instrument
- For acoustic instruments, you can tell apart instruments by their resonance filters

### Trautonium - Subtractive synthesis
- Start with a "harsh" waveform and remove components
  - Using filters
- Monophonic
- Keyboard input
  - Basically a voltage divider by pushing down a resistive wire to the wiper
  - Analog circuits do not turn off even not touching
    - Need gate control
- Circuitry
  - Exponentiating input voltage
    - Piano keyboard is exponential in frequency
      - Every Octave frequency is doubled
  - Using gas tubes
    - Normally non-conducting
    - In parallel with a capacitor
    - Charge and discharge cycle generates the frequency
  - Bar acts as a gate
    - For a modular, CV gate
- Subtractive synthesis
  - Easier to do in analog than digital
    - The discharging of the neon lamp is not bandlimited
  - Resonant low pass filter


## 01/29/26
### Hammond Organ
- Laurens Hammond
- Tone wheel organ
- All tone wheels are tuned to equal temperament scale
  - $f=440 \times 2^{(nn-69)/12}$
- 91 tone wheels on the same shaft
- Drawbars control the harmonics
  - Quasi-harmonic frequencies
    - Closest note to the harmonic that works
    - 1:2:2.996:4:5.0397
- Waveform is not periodic
  - Harmonics are not perfect multiples
  - Cannot be sampled

### Piano Reproduction
- Conlon Nancarrow
- Hand cut/compose rather than recorded
  - Can open up possibilities to pieces unplayable by human
- Precursor to MIDI

### RCA Synthesizer
- Olson and Belar
- Direct to disk multitrack
  - Multiple passes
- Duophonic synthesizer
- Directly recording to vinyl cutting machine
- Digital information
  - Relay trees are basically very slow DAC
  - Decode digitial paper record 
- Oscillator
  - Top octave oscillator
  - Digital synthesis
  - Divide by octaves digitally
- Paper record

### Analog Modular: Robert Moog
- "East coast studio"
- Modular and changeable controls typically called automation
- Done through analog control voltage
- Two types of control voltage
  - $f=kv$, used for amplitude and stuff
  - $f=f_0 * 2 ^{\frac{v}{v_0}}$, used for pitch and stuff
  - $f_0=\text{reference frequency}$
  - $v_0=\text{volts-per-octave or "Moogs"}$
- Audio and control signal are not differentiated in analog modular
- Control rate vs audio rate in digital domain
- CV is DC-coupled, can be constant voltage
- Audio is AC-coupled, centered at 0
- VCO/VCA/VCF/ADSR

### Analog Sequencing
- Don Buchla
- Simple analog sequencer (1970s)
- "West coast music"

### Storage and Playback of Audio
- LPCM
  - Linear pulse-coded modulation
  - Linear quantization of the audio
  - Modulating by a pulse train
    - Delayed by sample rate
