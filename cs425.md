### Overview
- What is a distributed system?
  - Hardware and software components located at networked computers that communicate or coordinate through passing messages
  - A collection of computing elements connected by a network
  - Independent components connected by network and passing messages to achieve a common goal as a single system
- Cascading failures
  - Failure in another computer of the distributed system can render the user's own computer unusable
- Why distributed systems
    - Scalability
    - Compute
    - Reliability/fault tolerance
    - Conquier geographic separation
    - Customize computers for speicifc tasks
### Scaling Example
- One server running both webserver and DB
- Two servers
  - One for server and one for db
  - System is offline twice as often
- Scalable number of front-end web server
  - Stateless
    - If a server crash, can reconnect user to another server
    - Use various policies to map users to front-ends
- Scalable number of dbs
  - Distributed systems code
  - Remains usable even with crash

### Challenges
- **Concurrent execution**
- **Independent failure**
- Autonomous administrationz

### Networked Communications
- **Async**
- **Unreliable**
- Insecure

### Common Goals
- **Consistency**
- Transparency
